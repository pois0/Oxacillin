/**
 * Returns the 20 most recent mentions (Tweets containing a users's @screen_name) for the authenticating user.
 * The timeline returned is the equivalent of the one seen when you view [your mentions](http://twitter.com/mentions) on twitter.com.
 * This method can only return up to 800 tweets.
 * See [Working with Timelines](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/timelines/guides/working-with-timelines) for instructions on traversing timelines.
 *
 * [Twitter API reference](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/timelines/api-reference/get-statuses-mentions_timeline)
 *
 * @param count Specifies the number of Tweets to try and retrieve, up to a maximum of 200. The value of count is best thought of as a limit to the number of tweets to return because suspended or deleted content is removed after the count has been applied. We include retweets in the count, even if include_rts is not supplied. It is recommended you always send include_rts=1 when using this API method.
 * @param sinceId Returns results with an ID greater than (that is, more recent than) the specified ID. There are limits to the number of Tweets which can be accessed through the API. If the limit of Tweets has occured since the since_id, the since_id will be forced to the oldest ID available.
 * @param maxId Returns results with an ID less than (that is, older than) or equal to the specified ID.
 * @param trimUser When set to either true , t or 1 , each tweet returned in a timeline will include a user object including only the status authors numerical ID. Omit this parameter to receive the complete user object.
 * @param includeEntities The entities node will not be included when set to false.
 * @param includeRTs Not documented yet.
 * @param includeMyRetweet Not documented yet.
 * @param tweetMode Not documented yet.
 * @param options Optional. Custom parameters of this request.
 * @receiver [Timeline] endpoint instance.
 * @return [JsonArrayApiAction] for [Status] model.
