/**
 * Allows a Consumer application to use an OAuth request_token to request user authorization.
 * This method is a replacement of [Section 6.2](http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#auth_step2) of the [OAuth 1.0 authentication flow](http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#anchor9) for applications using the callback authentication flow. The method will use the currently logged in user as the account for access authorization unless the force_login parameter is set to true.
 * This method differs from [GET oauth/authorize](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/api-reference/authorize) in that if the user has already granted the application permission, the redirect will occur without the user having to re-approve the application. To realize this behavior, you must enable the Use Sign in with Twitter setting on your [application record](https://developer.twitter.com/apps).
 * 
 * [Twitter API reference](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/api-reference/authenticate)
 * 
 * @param forceLogin Forces the user to enter their credentials to ensure the correct users account is authorized.
 * @param screenName Prefills the username input box of the OAuth login screen with the given value.
 * @param options Optional. Custom parameters of this request.
 * @receiver [OAuth] endpoint instance.
 * @return [Url].
