/**
 * Returns all lists the authenticating or specified user subscribes to, including their own. The user is specified using the user_id or screen_name parameters. If no user is given, the authenticating user is used.
 * A maximum of 100 results will be returned by this call. Subscribed lists are returned first, followed by owned lists. This means that if a user subscribes to 90 lists and owns 20 lists, this method returns 90 subscriptions and 10 owned lists. The reverse method returns owned lists first, so with reverse=true, 20 owned lists and 80 subscriptions would be returned. If your goal is to obtain every list a user owns or subscribes to, use [GET lists/ownerships](https://developer.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/lists/ownerships) and/or [GET lists/subscriptions](https://developer.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/lists/subscriptions) instead.
 * 
 * [Twitter API reference](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/create-manage-lists/api-reference/get-lists-list)
 *
 * @param reverse Set this to true if you would like owned lists to be returned first. See description above for information on how this parameter works.
 * @param options Optional. Custom parameters of this request.
 * @receiver [Lists] endpoint instance.
 * @return [JsonArrayApiAction] for [TwitterList] model.
