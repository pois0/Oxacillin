/**
 * Given a latitude and a longitude, searches for up to 20 places that can be used as a place_id when updating a status.
 * This request is an informative call and will deliver generalized results about geography.
 *
 * [Twitter API reference](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/geo/places-near-location/api-reference/get-geo-reverse_geocode)
 *
 * @param latitude The latitude to search around. This parameter will be ignored unless it is inside the range -90.0 to +90.0 (North is positive) inclusive. It will also be ignored if there isn't a corresponding long parameter.
 * @param longitude The longitude to search around. The valid ranges for longitude are -180.0 to +180.0 (East is positive) inclusive. This parameter will be ignored if outside that range, if it is not a number, if geo_enabled is disabled, or if there not a corresponding lat parameter.
 * @param accuracy A hint on the "region" in which to search. If a number, then this is a radius in meters, but it can also take a string that is suffixed with ft to specify feet. If this is not passed in, then it is assumed to be 0m. If coming from a device, in practice, this value is whatever accuracy the device has measuring its location (whether it be coming from a GPS, WiFi triangulation, etc.).
 * @param granularity This is the minimal granularity of place types to return and must be one of: neighborhood, city, admin or country . If no granularity is provided for the request neighborhood is assumed. Setting this to city, for example, will find places which have a type of city, admin or country.
 * @param maxResults A hint as to the number of results to return. This does not guarantee that the number of results returned will equal max_results, but instead informs how many "nearby" results to return. Ideally, only pass in the number of places you intend to display to the user here.
 * @param options Optional. Custom parameters of this request.
 * @receiver [Geo] endpoint instance.
 * @return [JsonGeneralApiAction] for [GeoResult] model.
