/**
 * Search for places that can be attached to a Tweet via [POST statuses/update](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/post-statuses-update). Given a latitude and a longitude pair, an IP address, or a name, this request will return a list of all the valid places that can be used as the place_id when updating a status.
 * Conceptually, a query can be made from the user's location, retrieve a list of places, have the user validate the location they are at, and then send the ID of this location with a call to [POST statuses/update](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/post-statuses-update).
 * This is the recommended method to use find places that can be attached to statuses/update. Unlike [GET geo/reverse_geocode](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/geo/places-near-location/api-reference/get-geo-reverse_geocode) which provides raw data access, this endpoint can potentially re-order places with regards to the user who is authenticated. This approach is also preferred for interactive place matching with the user.
 * Some parameters in this method are only required based on the existence of other parameters. For instance, "lat" is required if "long" is provided, and vice-versa. Authentication is recommended, but not required with this method.
 *
 * [Twitter API reference](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/geo/places-near-location/api-reference/get-geo-reverse_geocode)
 *
 * @param latitude The latitude to search around. This parameter will be ignored unless it is inside the range -90.0 to +90.0 (North is positive) inclusive. It will also be ignored if there isn't a corresponding long parameter.
 * @param longitude The longitude to search around. The valid ranges for longitude are -180.0 to +180.0 (East is positive) inclusive. This parameter will be ignored if outside that range, if it is not a number, if geo_enabled is disabled, or if there not a corresponding lat parameter.
 * @param query Free-form text to match against while executing a geo-based query, best suited for finding nearby locations by name. Remember to URL encode the query.
 * @param ip An IP address. Used when attempting to fix geolocation based off of the user's IP address.
 * @param granularity This is the minimal granularity of place types to return and must be one of: neighborhood, city, admin or country . If no granularity is provided for the request neighborhood is assumed. Setting this to city, for example, will find places which have a type of city, admin or country.
 * @param accuracy A hint on the "region" in which to search. If a number, then this is a radius in meters, but it can also take a string that is suffixed with ft to specify feet. If this is not passed in, then it is assumed to be 0m. If coming from a device, in practice, this value is whatever accuracy the device has measuring its location (whether it be coming from a GPS, WiFi triangulation, etc.).
 * @param maxResults A hint as to the number of results to return. This does not guarantee that the number of results returned will equal max_results, but instead informs how many "nearby" results to return. Ideally, only pass in the number of places you intend to display to the user here.
 * @param containedWithin This is the place_id which you would like to restrict the search results to. Setting this value means only places within the given place_id will be found. Specify a place_id. For example, to scope all results to places within "San Francisco, CA USA", you would specify a place_id of "5a110d312052166f".
 * @param attributeStreetAddress This parameter searches for places which have this given street address. There are other well-known, and application specific attributes available. Custom attributes are also permitted. Learn more about [Place attributes](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/geo-objects).
 * @param options Optional. Custom parameters of this request.
 * @receiver [Geo] endpoint instance.
 * @return [JsonGeneralApiAction] for [GeoResult] model.
