 * @param listId The numerical id of the list.
 * @param sinceId Returns results with an ID greater than (that is, more recent than) the specified ID. There are limits to the number of Tweets which can be accessed through the API. If the limit of Tweets has occured since the since_id, the since_id will be forced to the oldest ID available.
 * @param maxId Returns results with an ID less than (that is, older than) or equal to the specified ID.
 * @param count Specifies the number of results to retrieve per "page."
 * @param includeEntities Entities are ON by default in API 1.1, each tweet includes a node called "entities". This node offers a variety of metadata about the tweet in a discreet structure, including: user_mentions, urls, and hashtags. You can omit entities from the result by using include_entities=false
 * @param includeRTs When set to either true, t or 1, the list timeline will contain native retweets (if they exist) in addition to the standard stream of tweets. The output format of retweeted tweets is identical to the representation you see in home_timeline.
