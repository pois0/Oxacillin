/**
 * Returns fully-hydrated user objects for up to 100 users per request, as specified by comma-separated values passed to the user_id and/or screen_name parameters.
 * This method is especially useful when used in conjunction with collections of user IDs returned from GET friends / ids and GET followers / ids.
 * GET users / show is used to retrieve a single user object.
 * There are a few things to note when using this method.
 * - You must be following a protected user to be able to see their most recent status update. If you don't follow a protected user their status will be removed.
 * - The order of user IDs or screen names may not match the order of users in the returned array.
 * - If a requested user is unknown, suspended, or deleted, then that user will not be returned in the results list.
 * - If none of your lookup criteria can be satisfied by returning a user object, a HTTP 404 will be thrown.
 * - You are strongly encouraged to use a POST for larger requests.
 * 
 * [Twitter API reference](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/follow-search-get-users/api-reference/get-users-lookup)
 * 
 * @param screenNames A list of screen names, up to 100 are allowed in a single request. You are strongly encouraged to use a POST for larger (up to 100 screen names) requests.

 * @param options Optional. Custom parameters of this request.
 * @receiver [Users] endpoint instance.
